# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Busy day! Wrote a solution for Project Euler Problem 42. 

**Thoughts:** I've been working on the Project Euler problems for a while now, and really enjoy the mathematical challenges they pose. Problem 42 was a relatively straightforward one, in which you take an array of words, calculate whether each word is a triangle word, and return the count of all the words that are triangle words. I plan to refactor this problem and use the quadratic formula instead of manually calculating whether it's a triangle number!

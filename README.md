# 100 Days Of Code Log

### Day 0: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Busy day! Wrote a solution for Project Euler Problem 42. 

**Thoughts:** I've been working on the Project Euler problems for a while now, and really enjoy the mathematical challenges they pose. Problem 42 was a relatively straightforward one, in which you take an array of words, calculate whether each word is a triangle word, and return the count of all the words that are triangle words. I plan to refactor this problem and use the quadratic formula instead of manually calculating whether it's a triangle number!

### Day 1: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Another busy day of teaching. Worked on my solution for Project Euler Problem 43 this evening. 

**Thoughts:** I love the Project Euler challenges because I learn something new with each problem, or reinforce a pattern that I've used previously and refine or understand it more deeply. To solve today's problem on Sub-string divisibility, I made use of an older recursive solution for generating all possible permutations of 0-9 pandigital numbers. I tried the naive, brute-force approach first of looping through all ten-digit numbers and checking if they were pandigital, but my code was hanging. In the end, my algorithm is not the most efficient, but runs in about 4-5 seconds, which is well under the 60-second rule for P.E. Learned about and made use of `console.time` to measure how long my function took to run on my machine. 

Planning to spend some time working on larger projects soon, but finding that the P.E. problems definitely deliver on that hit of instant gratification and bite-size learnings that make me feel programming momentum on busy days.
